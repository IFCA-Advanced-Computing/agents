ABM example developed for Pandora framework based on the movement of a herd of cows around a dam. These cows will start from a barn and head to the dam until they reach it. From that moment they will spend their time eating the grass of the surface, producing manure as a result and moving around the dam. The surface will be composed of two rasters (or layers): "hierba" which contains the amount of grass available in each of the squares and "abono" which represents the quantity of manure in each place. We will load the GIS data into another raster called "gis" which will be used by the cows for their movement decisions.
